class BetterJSONStorage:
    """
    A class that represents a storage interface for reading and writing to a file.


    Attributes
    ----------
    `path: str`
        Path to file, if it does not exist it will be created only if the the 'r+' access mode is set.

    `access_mode: str, optional`
        Options are `'r'` for readonly (default), or `'r+'` for writing and reading.

    `kwargs:`
        These attributes will be passed on to `orjson.dumps`

    Methods
    -------
    `read() -> Mapping:`
        Returns the data from memory.

    `write(data: Mapping) -> None:`
        Writes data to file if acces mode is set to `r+`.

    `load() -> None:`
        loads the data from disk. This happens on object creation.
        Can be used when you suspect the data in memory and on disk are not in sync anymore.

    Raises
    ------
    `FileNotFoundError` when the file doesn't exist and `r+` is not set

    Notes
    ----
    If the directory specified in `path` does not exist it will only be created if access_mode is set to `'r+'`.
